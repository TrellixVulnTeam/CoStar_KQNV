================================================================
- results of performance evaluation on Nobel data set
- each bar is average of 10 parser runs on a single file

01_15_20_perf_report.png
========================
- result of profiling code with perf tool
- shows that mapping over the entire parser stack to extract the location
  from each frame takes up most of the computation time



01_22_20_benchmark_results_after_stack_sep.eps
==============================================
- average of 3 parser runs on each Nobel file
- runtime on largest file dropped from 20s to 4s

========================================
- most expensive operations are spClosureStep, add (maybe from adding to av
set), and app
