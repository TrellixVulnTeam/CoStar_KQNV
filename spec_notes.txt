left recursion
okay to assume no left-recursion--define predicate

ambiguity
prove that if an input is ambiguous, the parser will detect the ambiguity
defining two grammar relations--one for recognizing, one for deriving
prove that if the recognizer rel holds, parser returns a tree that corresponds
to that judgment

multiple prefixes problem
long-term--make prediction that covers longest prefix
short-term--require parser to cover entire input
